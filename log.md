# 100 Days Of Code - Log
---

### Day 1: October 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a Notion template for the challenge and submitted it for review. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to break a rule on the first day ðŸ˜¬ It says to not follow tutorials, but rather work on real projects. 
I will kick off with a 10 hour course in React from FreeCodeCamp, that is still working on cool projects, so hopefully no harm done.
First day of course was environment set-up and creating the first component in React. I have done this a few times but it does not
hurt to refresh the memory.

### Day 2: October 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Another 2 hours of the course completed. And another 2 hours troubleshooting why hot reload is not working.
After I gave up it just started working by itself... ðŸ˜• Programming...

### Day 3: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a simple stateless app that is supposed to look like Amazon Books. I even hosted it on Netlify. 
Watch out #jeffbezos there's a new player in town ðŸ˜‚

**Thoughts:** I thought you can only use netlify with GitHub. I was very wrong... (rubs hands)

### Day 6: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Day 6 was a day off ReactJS. Worked a bit on my portflio and tweaked a thing or two. Added a pulse animation that is used on the 
'back to top' button to the GitHub and form Submit buttons, just so they get more attention.

### Day 9: November 01, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 10hour React course done! I realised there is a complimentary 10hour video with 15 mini-projects. So...
Day 9 of #100daysofcode projects 1-3 done! https://1-out-of-15.netlify.app/ https://2-out-of-15.netlify.app/ https://3-out-of-15.netlify.app/

**Thoughts:** Always change the build setting in package.json to "set \"CI=false\" && react-scripts build", in order to build the project for production
