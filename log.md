# 100 Days Of Code - Log
---

### Day 1: October 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a Notion template for the challenge and submitted it for review. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to break a rule on the first day ðŸ˜¬ It says to not follow tutorials, but rather work on real projects. 
I will kick off with a 10 hour course in React from FreeCodeCamp, that is still working on cool projects, so hopefully no harm done.
First day of course was environment set-up and creating the first component in React. I have done this a few times but it does not
hurt to refresh the memory.

### Day 2: October 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Another 2 hours of the course completed. And another 2 hours troubleshooting why hot reload is not working.
After I gave up it just started working by itself... ðŸ˜• Programming...

### Day 3: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a simple stateless app that is supposed to look like Amazon Books. I even hosted it on Netlify. 
Watch out #jeffbezos there's a new player in town ðŸ˜‚

**Thoughts:** I thought you can only use netlify with GitHub. I was very wrong... (rubs hands)

### Day 5: October 28, 2020

### Day 6: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Day 6 was a day off ReactJS. Worked a bit on my portflio and tweaked a thing or two. Added a pulse animation that is used on the 
'back to top' button to the GitHub and form Submit buttons, just so they get more attention.

### Day 9: November 01, 2020

**Today's Progress:** 10hour React course done! I realised there is a complimentary 10hour video with 15 mini-projects. So...

### Day 16: November 09, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Day #16 from the #100daysofcode is a day off from React. Been meaning to implement my #AdobeXD mobile app designs to my portfolio a while now, and
finally got to do it today using iFrame. Still a bit buggy on mobile but good in general. --> https://goran.rocks/

### Day 17: November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Yesterday I decided to do something light and created a simple little JS game with the help of Ania Kubow. It is a Doodle Jump game that I will tweak and style in the next few days, just thinking how it should look? ðŸ¤” #100daysofcode

### Day 18: November 14, 2020

### Day 19: November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished up the doodle game, and as predicted I got a bit stuck with the restart button (still not working). Anyway, it looks good and it is playable so give it a go --> https://doodlejumpjs.netlify.app #100daysofcode

### Day 20: November 16, 2020

### Day 21: November 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** About a year ago I redeemed some free Udemy courses so I thought I should check what they are. Found one for a full-stack web app with MS SQL, ASP.NET and ReactJS. That should keep me busy for the next few days. Day #21 of #100daysofcode was the SQL setup for the app.

### Day 22: November 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Second day of full-stack app. Created a DB with a few tables and dummy data, created a Web API project in VS. Then I forced the Web API to give me a JSON instead of XML. Why? No idea, the guy in the video said so ðŸ˜‚ Day #22 of #100daysofcode
