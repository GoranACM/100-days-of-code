# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a Notion template for the challenge and submitted it for review. 

**Thoughts:** I decided to break a rule on the first day ðŸ˜¬ It says to not follow tutorials, but rather work on real projects. 
I will kick off with a 10 hour course in React from FreeCodeCamp, that is still working on cool projects, so hopefully no harm done.
First day of course was environment set-up and creating the first component in React. I have done this a few times but it does not
hurt to refresh the memory.
